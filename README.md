NodePolus is a JavaScript library containing Implementations for working with Among Us. It's planned to support:

- a custom **Region Server** with **Plugin** support
- a **Programmable Client** that can **Play Games**
- a proxy **Packet Inspector**

# Usage

Currently, the **client** and **packet inspector** parts of NodePolus are not usable. Check [our discord](https://discord.gg/Jpg4sWqeYH) for status updates.

the **Region Server** is usable, however **Plugin Support** is still in development
You can install the server by:
1. Install NodeJS 15.0.1 (or newer)
2. Download NodePolus
3. `npm install` or `npm i`
4. `npm start`
